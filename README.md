# BarStats

### BarStats is an application designed to show statistics for players of Beyond All Reason.
It shows a lot of metrics including total games played, win rates, average teammate ratings, as well as statistics on different maps, and it identifies top teammates and opponents.
The application also offers filtering options by map and number of games.
Currently, two versions are available:
1. a jar version for Desktops, which offers greater customization but lacks a user interface 
2. an Android version, which provides a cleaner interface but with less customization. 
You can download both versions in releases.
